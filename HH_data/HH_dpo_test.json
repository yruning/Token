Some of them are privately owned, and other are publicly traded on a stock exchange.  For privately-owned companies, their owners (the stockholders) are basically investors who take on risk and financial responsibilities to the owners.  The stockholders get to buy and sell shares of the company in the open market, and they can invest in the company in a number of different ways, such as by buying a part of a company through the use of debt (borrowing money to buy a part of the company) or buying a whole company through a merger or acquisition (buying another company).  Once the investors own shares of the company, they may vote on a number of different issues (ranging from what color the carpet should be, to major strategic decisions).  The bigger the company, the more votes the stockholders have.  Usually there is an official meeting where all the shareholders can vote on issues, and some companies even post a list of the top issues that will be discussed for all shareholders to vote on.\n\nSo to learn about how to buy and sell shares of companies, it\u2019s easiest to learn how to invest in the US stock market, since that\u2019s where a majority of the world\u2019s publicly-traded companies are located.

These fabrics are wash-and-wear, resistant to mold, bacteria and mildew, and will keep looking fresh and new longer.\n\nMost importantly: always try to make a habit of separating your laundry by material type (cotton, wool, etc.) and stain type (e.g. white, dark, red, etc.). Then, if you can, wash your clothes separately by type and only if you\u2019re sure your machine can handle it. Try to wear whites and darks in separate loads, for example. That way you\u2019ll be able to use less energy, water, and detergent, and your clothes will stay clean and keep their shape.\n\nI hope this helps!",
